## Introduction

`Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities but face challenges such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the models, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information.`
